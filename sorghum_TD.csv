Internode samples were lyophilized after sampling and crushed (<100 Âµm) with mixer mill (Retsch MM301). Cell wall residues (CWR, i.e. structural carbohydrates) were prepared from 100 mg of the powder weighted precisely. Samples were washed twice in 5 ml of distilled water at 80Â°C. After centrifugation (10 minutes, 10000 rpm), the pellet was rinsed twice in 5 ml of absolute ethanol for 15 min at 80Â°C, then rinsed twice in 5 ml of acetone at room temperature for 10 min and left to dry under a fume hood overnight at room temperature. CWR was weighed to calculate the percentage of CWR in dry matter. Lignin from the prepared cell wall residue (5 mg +/- 1 mg) was solubilized in 1 ml (V1) of acetyl bromide solution (acetyl bromide/acetic acid (1/4, v/v)) in a glass vial at 55Â°C for 2.5 hours under shaking. Samples were then let to cool down at room temperature and 1.2 ml of NaOH 2M/acetic acid (9/50, v/v) was added in the vial. 0.1 mL (V2) of this sample was transferred in 300 Âµl of 0.5M hydroxylamine chlorhydrate and mixed with 1.4 ml of acetic acid.
