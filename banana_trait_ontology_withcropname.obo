namespace: BananaTrait
def: "The degree to which food can recover between the end of the first bite and the beginning of the second bite in the mouth. Springiness represents the ability of boiled plantain to regain its ''elastic'' nature after compression. Springness is calculated as a ratio or percentage of a product’s recovery to its original height [(Distance 2)/(Distance 1)]*100 or (Time 2/Time 1)*100."
