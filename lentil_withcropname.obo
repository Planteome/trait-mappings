comment: The pathogen infects leaves, stems, petioles, pods and seeds. On leaves, young lesions with small necrotic spots of 3-5mm diameter can be found. Reddish brown to black pycnidia from in the middle of the mature lesions.  In severe infections, lesions gridle the stem, kill the epidermal and cortical cells and lead to stem breakage. Pods can also be infected and results seed infection. Heavily infected seeds look shrivelled and discoloured with a whitish mycelium and pycnidia.
