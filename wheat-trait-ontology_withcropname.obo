The first digit gives the relative height of the disease using the original 0-9 Saari-Prescott scale as a measure. The second digit shows the disease severity as a percentage but in terms of 0-9. Because it is difficult to evaluate diseases on dead leaves, disease notes should be taken when at least four leaves are still alive and green (soft to mid-dough growth stage). Then visually evaluate the average percentage severity on only those leaves of the uppermost four that are infected. In practice, the percent severity is estimated on an overall score. The following format is used for scoring severity: 10% coverage = 1, 20% coverage = 2, 30% coverage = 3, 40% coverage = 4, 50% coverage = 5, 60% coverage = 6, 70% coverage = 7, 80% coverage = 8, 90% coverage = 9.

False black chaff is a physiological condition resulting from a deposition of melaniod pigments and is completely associated with the presence of the stem rust resistance gene Sr2. Symptoms include brown to black discoloration of the glume extending from slight longitudinal marks to large black areas covering most of the glume surface. In severe expression, the stem area below the last node may become distinctly brown to black discoloured. The trait appears post-flowering with a peak at late milk-soft dough stage." [CO:curators]
